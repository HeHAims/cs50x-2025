# CS50x 2025 ‚Äî Week 0: Scratch Project

## üî± Theme:
**"Tzilacatzin: El C√≥dice Digital"**

In this project, a futuristic Aztec descendant named **Tzilacatzin** awakens inside a digital codex.  
As he walks and chants, he activates ancient power through logical sequences, loops, conditionals, and memory ‚Äî all built using Scratch.

> ‚ÄúEl c√≥digo es mi obsidiana. La terminal, mi campo de batalla.‚Äù

This project honors cultural roots while developing foundational programming logic for CS50.

This project represents my cultural identity and my personal journey into CS50x.
